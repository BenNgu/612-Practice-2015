       *****Version 1.0*****

Intro:

Get ready to raise a great civilization!
Build an army, raise an empire, and conquer
the world! Using a command prompt style gameplay,
you will be addicted to you own CIVILIZATION!

How to play:

This is a command prompt style game.
Press space to wake up the command prompt.
Type in a command (don't press space again!)
and press enter.
It may require you to answer futher questions.

Commands:

get(worker name) - get a worker with resources. (EX: getFarmer)
sell(worker name) - sell a worker for resouces. (EX: sellLogger)
attack - attack other civilization for resouces.

Workers:

Farmer - Increases food production, cost 50 food.
Logger - Increases wood production, cost 50 food.
Miner - Increases gold production, cost 50 food.
Soldier - Increases Attack and Defense, cost 50 food & 10 wood.
Wall - Doesn't increase population, increases Defense, cost 100 wood.

Mechanics:

Each farmer produces 3 food per second, but consume 1 themselves.
Each worker(except for wall)  consume 1 food per second, so there 
should be as many farmers as other workers. Attack and Defence are 
important for protecting resouces. Walls are better than Soldiers, 
but doesn't increase attack.
